Problem-4
program is doen by using javascript

In html file,
one input field for recieving array of data
click button to execute program logic.
refresh button to refresh the page after executing each program.
And empty p tag to display the result.

In app.js file,
generate function is defined initially.
In that,
Since the result is displayed as Key:value pair,
a constant 'num' is declared to assign value to key which is 1 to 9.
findtotalcount is a function which have a parameter arr,which defines,
declaring an empty variable obj to assign the key value pair in it.
map funtion is used to define that key values in the key:value pair are num.
Then in map function,the array is filtered to check in such a way that for each values of key,array have its multples or it divides completely.
Then length(count) is assigned to the value in key value pair.
then the input array is required using variable data and this data split to have the array contains 
each string elements.
then displaying the result.


refresh function reloads the page to be used after each program is done.
