Initially, In the html file,created two input field for Value 'a' and 'b'
Then fourbuttons showing four arithmetic Operation(Addition,Subtraction,Division,Multiplication) having unique functions.

In app.js file,
 Each function is defined.

 And then another two variable each of that required varible is converted to double datatype format by ParseFloat.
 
 After that,
